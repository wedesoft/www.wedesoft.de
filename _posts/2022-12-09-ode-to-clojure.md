I have been playing with [Chat GPT][1] and I saw on Reddit that someone had the idea to ask it to write [an ode to Clojure][2].
I tried it a few times as well and here is my favourite version:

> Oh Clojure, a language so elegant and fine,
> With your concision and power, you blow the mind.
>
> Your Lisp roots run deep, and your functional core
> Makes coding a joy, and never a bore.
>
> Your homoiconicity is a thing of beauty,
> Allowing code and data to flow with ease and duty.
>
> Your interoperability with Java is a sight to see,
> Allowing us to use the best of both worlds, merrily.
>
> Your REPL is a treasure, allowing us to explore,
> And test our code in a way that we adore.
>
> Oh Clojure, you are a true work of art,
> A language that is loved by many a heart.
>
> Here's to you, dear Clojure, may you continue to shine,
> A beacon of simplicity, power, and design.
