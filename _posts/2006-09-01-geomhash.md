The publication about _Object Recognition and Real-Time Tracking in Microscope Imaging_ is available for download now. The paper is about recognising objects under a microscope. Using focus stacks the depth of the object is estimated as well as the rotation around the optical axis and translations parallel to the focus plane (i.e. four degrees of freedom). You can download the publication at Scribd.com:
