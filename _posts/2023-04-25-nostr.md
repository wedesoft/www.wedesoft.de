title: How to use the Nostr social network via the iris.to web client

Social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp, and others are run by companies.
When using these networks to stay in touch with friends, you have to trust the company with the content of your conversations.
Usually the companies mine the data and inject targeted advertising into your feed.
Also secret algorithms are used to emphasize or de-emphasize information and one has to trust the company that it is not using these mechanisms to influence public opinion.

However there is now an alternative called [Nostr][1].
Nostr is an open protocol and a network of participating relays and clients.
In a similar fashion as Bitcoin, the network is distributed (i.e. there are multiple relays) and accounts are just a pair of secret and public key.
I.e. similar as with Bitcoin there is no registration using email and/or mobile phone number required.
Because users are not bound to a particular client (or relay), they can without effort switch clients and relays if the interface becomes cluttered with ads or if the quality of service is low in any other way.

I have tested a few clients (for desktop and web) and at the moment in my opinion the web application [iris.to][2] is the best choice.
Now I am going to give you a non-technical guide on how to get started using this web application.

## Using the Iris.to Nostr client web application
When opening the website the first time one is greeted with a login page.
The login page asks you for your display name and here I just entered <code>test</code> for demonstration purposes.
When clicking **Go**, the web application creates a public and private key pair.

The next page shows you a selection of popular accounts which you can choose to add to your feed by pressing one or more of the **Follow** buttons.

The next page lets you choose a unique user name for the iris.to website.
If you for example choose <code>testit</code>, you get a human-readable Nostr identity (a so called NIP-05 name) called <code>testit@iris.to</code>.
Of course you can always choose to get a new Nostr identity from another website.
If you have a private homepage with the URL <code>https://myhomepage.org</code>, you can even create your own Nostr identity <code>testit@myhomepage.org</code>.
More about this later.

If you navigate to the account page, you will see your public key, which is a long string starting with <code>npub...</code>.
![Iris.to account public key](/pics/iris-4-account.png)

If you scroll down, you will see a button to copy your private key to the clipboard.
The secret key is a long string starting with <code>nsec...</code>.
Now is a good time to store this private key securely, otherwise you will permanently loose access to this account.
If you loose your secret key, your only option is to start over with a new account.

When clicking on the home icon, one gets presented with two options:
* **Following**: show messages from accounts you follow
* **Global**: show messages from your extended social network

When clicking on **Following**, you will see a real-time feed from accounts you follow.
Also the top of the page shows you a button to copy a link to your public feed to the clipboard.
If you haven't chosen a human-readable Nostr identity, the link will be something like <code>https://iris.to/npub...</code>.
If you have chosen the name <code>testit</code>, your public link will be <code>https://iris.to/testit</code>.
If you are using your private homepage to create a Nostr identity, you can also use <code>https://iris.to/testit@myhomepage.org</code> as public link.

## Advanced Users
### Nostr extension login
You might have noticed that in my screenshot the login page has a clickable **Nostr extension login** link.
This is because I am using the Firefox extension [nos2x-fox][3] which manages logging in without revealing the private key to the web application.
In my case if I go to the account page, there is no option to copy the private key because the web application does not know it.
In a similar fashion, desktop clients can post messages to relay servers without revealing the private key.

### NIP-05 name using private homepage
Note that the account page also has a **Copy hex** button which lets you copy your public key in hexadecimal form.
In order to use your homepage to give you a check mark verifying the NIP-05 name <code>testit@myhomepage.org</code>, you need to place a JSON file at <code>https://myhomepage.org/.well-known/nostr.json</code> with the following content:

{% highlight json %}
{"names":{"testit":"<your public hex key>"}}
{% endhighlight %}

Also you need to enable CORS.
You can do this by adding a <code>.htaccess</code> file with the following content in the <code>.well-known</code> folder:
{% highlight shell %}
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization"
{% endhighlight %}

Enjoy!

Also you can follow me.

My public Nostr key is ...

<code>npub12n5uzstmwww0vrne25lkdr68vugeqsh78r022vlzm2jh9rp7uz7qs0w3nr</code>

... and my NIP-05 name is <code>jan@wedesoft.de</code>.
