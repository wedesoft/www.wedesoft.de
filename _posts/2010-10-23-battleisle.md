You can [download Battle Isle 1][abandon] (Moon of Chromos) free of charge at Abandonia and you can run it under GNU/Linux using [DOSBox] (update: DOSBox also runs on Windows and MacOS).
Battle Isle is a turn-based strategy game.
The game can be played against the computer as well as against another human player.
It always runs in split-screen mode.
_I.e._ each player specifies the moves using half of the screen.

Here's how to run the game (under GNU/Linux) after downloading it

{% highlight shell %}
unzip 'Battle Isle 93 - The Moon of Chromos.zip'
cd BI193
dosbox MOON.EXE -exit
cd ..
{% endhighlight %}

<ul><li>First player keys
<ul><li>'⇦', '⇨', '⇩', and '⇧' to move the cursor</li>
<li>'⏎' and cursor movement to select action</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second player keys
<ul><li>'x', 'v', 'c', and 'd' to move the cursor</li>
<li>'ctrl' and cursor movement to select action</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Here's a gameplay video of the Amiga version of the game.
