Sometime ago I discovered the [AXM Paper Space Scale Models][1] website.
On the website Alfonso X Moreno published various paper scale models of the Space Shuttle, the ISS, the Tiangong, SpaceX Starship, and others.

I downloaded the [SpaceX Crew Dragon paper model][2] and I donated a bit of money for it.
I used *pdftk* to split the PDF document into single- and double-sided jobs.
Then I used [doxdirect.com][3] to get it printed, because they offer printing on 160gsm paper (normal office paper is only 80gsm and is not strong enough).

I couldn't find instructions on the website on how to build the docking version of the paper model.
Finally I found an instructional video on Youtube:

Here is the finished Crew Dragon capsule (I will do the service module later).

I can really recommend to check out [AXM's website][1] if you are into paper models.

Enjoy and Merry Christmas!
