I finally decided to update my laptop to **[Kubuntu 10.04][Kubuntu]** (a distribution of GNU/Linux based on [Debian]). As usual I used the Live DVD to just rename the _/home_ folder to _/old_, delete everything else, and mount the partitions in the advanced setup without formatting them (although like this I wasn't able to make use of the new EXT4 file system). For new users there is an article how to do a [graphical installation of Kubuntu][install].

KDE4 really has some nice eye candy. Also there are themes for many things and you can just download them using the configuration dialogs. Here's a screenshot of the [Kubuntu Spotlight] theme I chose for the login manager.

For the boot splash animation I used the [Spectrum] theme.

And here is a screenshot of the desktop in action.

The distribution can be downloaded free of charge at [http://www.kubuntu.org/][Kubuntu]. There are few issues with the [HP Compaq nx7400 notebook][Compaq] I am using. So far I've found the following problems:

* [NetworkManager disables itself][Network] before going into standby and doesn't come back when disconnecting power during standby mode (one needs to edit the file */var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state*). Also when using another tool such as pppoeconfig, [NetworkManager will disable itself using another configuration file][Network2] (one needs to edit the file */etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf*).
* VoIP settings: One needs to switch everything in Twinkle to ALSA/Default.
* When not terminated properly, Amarok gives the error message "Amarok is already running!" even though it is not running.
* Sometimes one needs to restart Amarok because it stops playing after every song.
* The Shoutcast list is not included in Amarok any more but there is an Amarok script for [adding Shoutcast to Amarok][Shoutcast].
* I had to install [msn-pecan] because Pidgin's default implementation for MSN has issues.
* Pidgin won't connect to ICQ unless _Use clientLogin_ is checked in the advanced account settings.
* The waste bin has become a plasma widget which is not on the desktop by default.
* As usual one needs to fetch additional codecs and libdvdcss from the [Medibuntu] repository in order to be able to play videos using patent-encumbered codecs and DVDs.
* The file associations for PDF documents are configured to prefer the proprietary Acrobat Reader over the Okular free software.
* WPA2 wireless keeps disconnecting (iwl3945 driver, deauthenticating by local choice (reason=3)). Installing [install the linux backports modules][backports] doesn't seem to help either at this point in time.
* The default output device for mplayer is _xmga_. You need to change it to _xv_.
* One of the ALSA volume controls for the microphone seems to be mislabelled as the 'Digital' input.

**Update:**

I posted about [listing manually selected packages with aptitude][apt] on the Ubuntu Forum. This is very useful for generating the command line for installing the same set of packages on a new machine (*e.g.* my new [HP G56-108SA][g56] ;)). One can list the manually selected packages as follows:

{% highlight shell %}
aptitude search '!~M ~i' -F '%p'
{% endhighlight %}

*I.e.* you can run the following command on one machine:

{% highlight shell %}
echo aptitude install `aptitude search '!~M ~i' -F '%p'` > install.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Then you copy the resulting file *install.sh* to the target machine and run

{% highlight shell %}
sh ./install.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Basically **!~M** selects not automatically selected packages and **~i** selects installed packages. See content of package **aptitude-doc-en** for more information.

Note that you might have to manually modify the file *install.sh* if the package names on the target system are different (*e.g.* 32-bit vs. 64-bit, other proprietary wireless driver, ...).

**Update:**

Here's a nice example of a dual-screen desktop running the same *Kubuntu* version.
