I finally did the [Blender Guru donut tutorial][3] for beginners.
[Blender][4] is a powerful 3D editor to create models and animate them.
Here is a series of images made while progressing through the tutorial.

Initially one creates a torus and distorts it.
Furthermore the upper half of the torus is copied, solidified, and sculpted to create the icing of the donut.

One can set the material properties of the donut to make the icing more reflective and add subsurface scattering.

Here is another example using white icing.

One can use texture painting to add a bright ring at the middle height of the torus.

Using geometry nodes one can distribute cylindrical sprinkles on the surface and rotate them randomly around the surface normal.
By doing weight painting one can ensure that the sprinkles are less frequent on the sides of the donut.

Furthermore one can select from a set of differently shaped sprinkles and color them randomly using a color map with a few distinct colors.

Using key, fill, and rim lighting, one can illuminate the donut.

Compositing is used to add a background with a blurred white circle creating a color gradient.
Also one can add lens distortion and color dispersion to make the image look more like a photo.

See below for the resulting video:

I really enjoyed the tutorial and I hope I will remember the right tool at the right moment when creating models in the future.

All the time there are people finishing the tutorial and posting it on [r/BlenderDoughnuts][1].
