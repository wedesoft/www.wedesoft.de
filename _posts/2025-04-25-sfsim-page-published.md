I finally managed to get enough of a prototype together to make a page about [sfsim][1] (space flight simulator).
I was inspired by realistic space flight simulators like Orbiter 2016 and I decided to start a cross-platform project based on LWJGL/OpenGL.
The plan is to support vertical launch, space station docking, moon landing, reentry, and landing on a runway in the future.
The page features a new trailer demonstrating the aerodynamics prototype:

Also my application as a Steam developer was accepted and the Steam app page for *sfsim* was approved.
You can find the page [here][2].
If you are interested in a space flight simulator with realistic physics, just add *sfsim* to your Steam wishlist to get notified when it is released:

Let me know in the comments if there is anything you would like to see in a realistic space flight simulator.
