The [RubyConf 2009][Rubyconf] took place near San Francisco. I gave a talk about **Computer vision using [Ruby] and [libJIT]**. Here is the [abstract of the talk][talk]:

<blockquote>
<p>Ruby originated in Japan, the country which is world-leading in robotic research. It suggests itself to put the two together and to start using Ruby as a language to program robots. However at the moment the performance of available Ruby interpreters is not sufficient. It is hard to achieve performance comparable to compiled C++-code since manipulation of Ruby-integers and Ruby-arrays requires frequent bounds-checking. It can be shown that universal bounds-check elimination is actually impossible.</p>
<p>This talk presents HornetsEye which is a Ruby-extension facilitating the development of real-time machine vision algorithms for future robotic applications. HornetsEye offers I/O facilities to capture and display videos. HornetsEye also can be integrated into GUI-applications developed with Qt4-QtRuby. Furthermore there is a set of Ruby classes which provides the means to compose native datatypes and specify operations on them. The libJIT just-in-time compiler is used to achieve real-time performance. The project was inspired by NArray and ruby-libjit.</p>
</blockquote>

The software is called [HornetsEye] and it is available under the terms and conditions of the GPL.

Feel free to leave comments below.

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<h4>Lazy computation</h4>
Future work on [HornetsEye] could be about using lazy computation to avoid
the creation of intermediate results when doing array operations. Here's a
small prototype implementation. Let me know if you have any suggestions.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Promise
  def initialize( size, &action )
    @size, @action = size, action
  end
  def inspect
    "Promise(#{@size})"
  end
  def []( index )
    @action.call index
  end
  def demand
    Seq[ *( 0 ... @size ).collect { |i| @action.call i } ]
  end
  def -@
    Promise.new( @size ) { |i| -@action.call( i ) }
  end
  def fill!( value = 0 )
    @action = proc { |i| value }
    self
  end
end

class Seq
  class << self
    def []( *args )
      retval = new args.size
      retval.data = args
      retval
    end
    def new( size )
      unless Thread.current[ :lazy ]
        super size
      else
        Promise.new( size ) { 0 }
      end
    end
  end
  attr_accessor :data
  def initialize( size )
    @data = [ 0 ] * size
  end
  def inspect
    "Seq#{@data.inspect}"
  end
  def []( index )
    @data[ index ]
  end
  def -@
    Seq[ *@data.collect { |x| -x } ]
  end
  def fill!( value = 0 )
    @data = [ value ] * @data.size
    self
  end
end

def lazy
  previous_state = Thread.current[ :lazy ]
  Thread.current[ :lazy ] = true
  retval = yield
  Thread.current[ :lazy ] = previous_state
  if retval.is_a? Array
    retval.collect { |x| x.demand }
  else
    retval.demand
  end
end
# Ordinary computation
a = -Seq.new( 3 ).fill!( 1 )
# Simple lazy computation
b = lazy { -Seq.new( 3 ).fill!( 1 ) }
# ...
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>Reflection</h4>
Using the following code one can use reflection to interpret Ruby code in
order to for example translate it to machine code later.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Const
  attr_accessor :inspect
  alias_method :to_s, :inspect
  def initialize( s )
    @inspect = s.to_s
  end
  def method_missing( name, *args )
    str = "#{ self }.#{ name }"
    unless args.empty?
      str += "( #{args.join ', '} )"
    end
    Const.new str
  end
  def coerce( y )
    return Const.new( y ), self
  end
end
a = Const.new 'a'
# a
b = Const.new 'b'
# b
-a
# a.-@
a + b
# a.+( b )
a[ 2 ]
# a[]( 2 )
2 * a
# 2.*( a )
2 * a + b
# 2.*( a ).+( b )
2 * ( a + b )
# 2.*( a.+( b ) )
{% endhighlight %}


Unfortunately Ruby reflection does not capture creation of variables,
assignment of values, and control structures such as _while_ or _if-then-else_.

<h4>GPU</h4>
One could use "monkey patching" to add GPU support (using OpenCL) in a
transparent way. Furthermore it would be desirable to make use of multi-core
computers. Ruby 1.9 supports native threads but there is a global interpreter
lock on extension calls. So multi-threading has to be implemented explicitely
if it is to be used in such a Ruby extension.

<h4>Technical Issues</h4>
It was suggested to me to

* make the array classes available separately
* to use [Rubygems] for packaging the software and [Gemcutter] for publishing the software
* to use [Git] for version control and to host the repositories on [Github]
* to use [ffi] so that the extension works with different Ruby VMs (JRuby, Rubinius, ...)
