I play a bit of music using a [Hohner Special 20][2] bluesharp.
However I am not quick enough at reading sheet music, so I need to add tabs.
Tabs basically tell you the number of the hole to play and whether to blow (B) or draw (D).
[Lilypond][1] is a concise programming language to generate sheet music.
It turns out, that it is very easy to add lyrics using Lilypond.
By putting the tabs in double quotes it is possible to add the tabs to the music.
I found the tune [Hard Times][3] on the Internet and I used Lilypond to create a version with tabs.
Here is the Lilypond code:

```
\version "2.22.0"
\header {
  title = "Hard Times"
  composer = "Stephen Foster"
  instrument = "Bluesharp"
}
\relative {
  r2 c'4 d
  e2 e4 d
  e8 g4.~ g4 e
  d4 c c d8 c
  e2 c'4 a
  g2 e8 c4.
  d4. c8 e4 d
  c1~
  c2 c4 d
  e2 e4 d
  e8 g4.~ g4 e
  d4 c c d8 c
  e2 c'4 a
  g2 e8 c4.
  d4. c8 e4 d
  c1~
  c2 e4 f4
  g2. g4
  g2 f4 g4
  a1
  g2 r2
  c2 a8 g4.
  e2 d8 c4.
  d4. c8 d4 e
  d2 c4 d
  e2 e4 d
  e8 g4.~ g4 e
  d4 c c d8 c
  e2 c'4 a
  g2 e8 c4.
  d4. c8 e4 d
  c1~
  c4 r4 r2
}

\addlyrics {
  "4B" "4D" "5B" "5B" "4D" "5B" "6B" "5B" "4D" "4B" "4B" "4D" "4B" "5B" "7B" "6D" "6B" "5B" "4B" "4D" "4B" "5B" "4D" "4B"
  "4B" "4D" "5B" "5B" "4D" "5B" "6B" "5B" "4D" "4B" "4B" "4D" "4B" "5B" "7B" "6D" "6B" "5B" "4B" "4D" "4B" "5B" "4D" "4B"
  "5B" "5D" "6B" "6B" "6B" "5D" "6B" "6D" "6B" "7B" "6D" "6B" "5B" "4D" "4B" "4D" "4B" "4D" "5B" "4D"
  "4B" "4D" "5B" "5B" "4D" "5B" "6B" "5B" "4D" "4B" "4B" "4D" "4B" "5B" "7B" "6D" "6B" "5B" "4B" "4D" "4B" "5B" "4D" "4B"
}
```

Here is the output generated by Lilypond.
Notice how the tabs get aligned to the notes automatically.

I can really recommend to sign up for [David Barrett's harmonica videos][4] to learn tongue blocking which is essential to play single notes as in this example.

Enjoy!
